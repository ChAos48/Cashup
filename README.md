Cashup is an application I developed to help with the cashup proccess at a retail store in South Africa.
The way to use it is the following:

DB_WORK BRANCH!!!

1. Count all the money in the Till (counting the number of each denomination)
2. Enter all the figures in the fields provided in the application.
3. Select which til you are using (designed for a specific store with 6 Tills and 3 of them can be used as night shift tills)
4. Ensure the Float is correct.
5. Ensure the date is correct.
6. Enter your name in the name field.
7. click total.
8. make sure all the figures seem correct.
9. click print(will open print dialog).
10. cut along the lines on the printed page to use as documentation.
